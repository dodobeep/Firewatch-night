Firewatch inspired relaxing CSS animation - tower during the night

This is a modified full screen night version of this animation by Travis Doughty (@tdoughty): https://codepen.io/tdoughty/pen/bGGZWqg
The code is a mess, but the animation is nice.

Check it out with the netlify link.
Also check out the day version with signature firewatch orange color palette.
